# warmair_intrusion_detection

Algorithm for detecting warm air intrusions for analyzing sea ice concentration algorithms. Core-algorithm used in "Relevance of warm air intrusions for Arctic satellite sea ice
concentration climate data records" by Rostosky, P. and Spreen, G. (2023). doi = 10.5194/tc-2023-69

The core functions are provided in warmair_detection_algorithm.py. A running example is given in example.py. In addition, in WAI_summary, an overview of all detected warm air intrusions for the timeperiod from 1979 to 2020 is provided.
